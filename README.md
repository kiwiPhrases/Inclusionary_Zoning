### Inclusionary_Zoning
This repository contains code for aggregating, preparing, and visually analyzing data pertaining to inclusionary zoning. 

#### Data
1-year American Survey data for select cities. The dataset either revolve around Washington, DC or around California cities. Additionally, in order to extend the history of the dataset, we include 1980, 1990, and 2000 census data for California cities.

#### Purpose
- Collate demographics, housing, and income data from 2006 to 2015 for the select set of cities.
- Do some preliminary visual analysis. 
- Since this data is primarily for a public policy course at USC, analysis is performed(unforunately) in Stata.
